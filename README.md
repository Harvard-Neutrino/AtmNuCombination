# AtmNuCombination

Initial plots are done already. I am moving on to include oscillation probabilities to sterile neutrinos in the distributions.

I am also starting to figure out using the flux for <10GeV and >100GeV neutrino events.

In the meantime I am figuring out constants for matter effect in different layers of the Earth.
